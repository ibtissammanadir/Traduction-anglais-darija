# Darija Translator Project

Welcome to the Darija Translator Project README! This project focuses on creating an automatic translation system for Darija, a dialect widely spoken in Morocco. Our goal is to bridge the communication gap between Darija speakers and those unfamiliar with the language, facilitating intercultural communication and promoting linguistic and cultural diversity in Morocco.

## Getting Started

This project is an ambitious effort by engineering students from the Ecole Nationale des Sciences Appliqu√©es de Marrakech, aiming to develop an English-Darija automatic translator using advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

### Project Overview

Darija, while rich in culture, presents unique challenges for automatic translation due to its distinctive vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and syntactic structure. Our project addresses these challenges by developing a system that not only translates English to Darija but also captures the nuance and essence of the local dialect.

### Technical Approach

We utilized Python for its rich ecosystem of libraries suitable for data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing, including Numpy, Torch, and others. Our approach combines data preprocessing, model training with encoder-decoder architecture, and performance evaluation to create a functional and effective translation tool.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Offers an introduction to the application, showcasing Moroccan culture and providing access to the translation page.
- **Translation Page:** Users can input sentences to be translated from English to Darija, facilitating communication.
- **Underlying Structure:** Utilizes a class and sequence diagram to delineate the project's architecture and functionalities.

## Algorithmic Study

The core of our project revolves around data collection and preprocessing, the development of encoder-decoder models, and training methodologies that include teacher forcing and performance evaluation based on loss metrics.

## Challenges and Improvements

While we've made significant strides, the translation of Darija continues to be an area ripe for further research and development. Future efforts will focus on refining translation models, expanding vocabulary coverage, and enhancing the system's ability to understand cultural nuances.

## Conclusion

The Darija Translator Project marks a significant step towards overcoming the linguistic barriers that divide speakers of English and Darija. As we continue to refine our system, we remain committed to enhancing intercultural communication and celebrating Morocco's rich linguistic heritage.
